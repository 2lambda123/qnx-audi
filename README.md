### Description
QNX-Audi is a simple 2D game built for Audi's MMI 3G+.  
To run this game you must simply insert your SD card into Audi car (you can check video above).  
It was created, based on reversed libraries from the Audi's MMI.  

### Tested on  
- Facelift Audi A4 B8  
- No facelift Audi A6 C7  
- x86 QNX Neutrino (6.4)  

### Features
* OpenGL drawing (2.0)
* Keyboard access
* Supported architectures: SHLE (Audi) and x86 (PC)  
  
This is a proof of concept project, so you may encounter redundant code and workarounds for some problems.

## Getting Started  

### How to run this project 
1. Download latest release from [releases](https://github.com/h4570/qnx-audi/releases)  
2. Unpack archive to your SD card
3. Turn on the ignition in the car
4. Insert the SD card (repeat if game not run in 15 seconds~)
5. Play with the main knob and the volume knob.
6. When you don't want to play, [restart the MMI with the key combination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hyHICHfQ8)  

### How to build this project 
To build this project you need to mix couple of versions of QNX SDK.  
From what I remember it is 6.3.2 + 6.4.0 + 6.5.0.  
In the future, there will be tutorial, how to compile this project.
